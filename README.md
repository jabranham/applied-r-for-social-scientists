This repository contains the materials for "Applied R for Social
Scientists," a workshop run in April 2016 at the University of Texas.
The workshop is designed to give participants an introduction to the R
statistical environment. It makes the assumption that participants
have at least seen R before, but that they are not comfortable working
in it. 

# How to use

You can download the entire repository to your computer using the
"download zip" link on this page. You'll then need to unzip the file.

Alternatively, you can do a simple git clone:

    git clone https://github.com/jabranham/applied-r-for-social-scientists.git

I've included the slides as a pdf and the code as a .R file for
convenience. They are both exported from the
[rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) file.
