This repository contains the materials for "Applied R for Social
Scientists," a workshop run in April 2016 at the University of Texas.
The workshop is designed to give participants an introduction to the R
statistical environment. It makes the assumption that participants
have at least seen R before, but that they are not comfortable working
in it. 

# How to use
You can download the entire repository to your computer using the
"download zip" link on this page. You'll then need to unzip the file.
Using a text editor (emacs, sublime text, etc) or RStudio, open
"R-for-data-analysis.R" to start. You will need an internet connection
in order to download the data file and packages, if they aren't
already installed.
